			<h3>Red Note Foundation</h3>
			<p>Red Note Foundation is an orginization to which I volunteer between 10 and 30 hours a week towards. I hold the "Technology Director" position, yet it is all volunteer work. I am responsible for the website design and content along with all eNewsletter design and distrbution. I also share the social media management responsibilty with one team member. Additionally, I serve as the primary Event Planner for all major benefit events.</p>

			<h3>RatherFit</h3>
			<p>As part of my final project through Portland Code School, I participated in a group project. Our final project was <a href='http://ratherfit.herokuapp.com/'>RatherFit</a>, an online tool that uses a few simple questions to Guide Your Path to A Better You. The results of these questions return video results of exercise and fitness routines. I was mainly responsible for the YouTube API request and node server work. I also handled all Orchestrate data pushes and calls through the node server with some additional backbone view and model manipulation.</p>
